# Autonomous-warehouse-car (UDEM) / Until May 2025

An autonomous warehouse car system using the Hiwonder omnidirectional car and Universal Robot UR3e within a warehouse grid-like route.

## Overview

This project focuses on the integration of the Hiwonder TurboPi omnidirectional robot car and the Universal Robot UR3e for automated navigation and item manipulation in a grid-based warehouse environment. The system aims to enhance efficiency in warehouse operations by automating key tasks like object transportation and placement.

### Key Components
- **Hiwonder TurboPi Omnidirectional Car**: Provides precise movement and flexibility within the warehouse grid.
- **Universal Robot UR3e**: Performs robotic arm manipulation tasks, such as picking and placing objects.
